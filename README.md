# Task Management Application

This is a task management application built using Angular 14+, implementing a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality for managing tasks. The application uses **localStorage** to persist task data and leverages **Angular Material** for a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

- **Task List**: Displays all tasks in a list format with the ability to view, edit, or delete tasks.
- **Create Task**: A form to create new tasks with basic validation.
- **Edit Task**: Allows editing of existing tasks.
- **View Task**: A detailed view of each task's information.
- **Task Deletion**: Allows users to delete one or more tasks at a time.
- **Task Filtering**: Search and filter tasks by name, description, and status.
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Task data is stored in **localStorage**, so it persists across page reloads.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended version: LTS)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (Angular 14 or higher)
